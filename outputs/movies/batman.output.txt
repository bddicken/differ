------- BATMAN BEGINS -----


DUCARD: Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to
        take them on one at a time?

BRUCE: Actually there were seven of them.

DUCARD: I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

BRUCE: How do you know my name?

DUCARD: The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear, no
        matter how deep he chooses to sink.

BRUCE: Who are you?

DUCARD: My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Ra's Al Ghul, a man greatly
        feared by the criminal underworld. A man who can offer you a path.
